Bids/Asks are orders (so all sells will be asks, all buys will be bids)

Since you:
   * Buy at the Ask
   * Sell at the Bid
    
So your:
   * [Sell Order] will be in the Asks
   * [Buy order] will be in the Bids
   
   
Right now the rules are:
   * You can buy or sell stock
   * All orders are market orders
   * You can have a partial completion of your order
